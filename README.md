# Scrapelets

[Bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) to scrape things. Occasionally useful.

The links bookmarklets themselves can't be embedded in this readme, but you can get them [here](https://bakkot.github.io/Scrapelets/).

* Axess student enrollment: for Stanford TAs; the [student enrollment](https://axess.sahr.stanford.edu/group/guest/view-class-lists) page for a given class gives a badly-formatted HTML table with the ability to export a badly-formatted Excel file. This bookmarklet gives you a CSV instead.
